# Breathing Cycles - Pustemusikk

Breathing Cycles, also known as **Pustemusikk**, is a concept that uses music to guide breathing. The music leads inhalation and exhalation, helping to reduce stress, lower cholesterol, and improve the body's ability to handle challenging situations among many other benefits.
