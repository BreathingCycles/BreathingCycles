# Breathing Cycles - Pustemusikk

Breathing Cycles, also known as **Pustemusikk**, is a concept that uses music to guide breathing. The music leads inhalation and exhalation, helping to reduce stress, lower cholesterol, and improve the body's ability to handle challenging situations among many other benefits. 

## 🎶 About the Website
This website provides access to various playlists and albums designed to support breathing techniques. All playlists are available on **Spotify**.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Choose a playlist** based on the breathing rhythm you want to practice.
2. **Listen and follow the music** – it will naturally guide your inhale and exhale cycles.
3. **In headphones, the inhalation starts on the left side and moves towards the center before exhalation continues on the right side**. The music will guide you. 
4. **Experience the benefits of controlled breathing**:
   - **Stress Reduction:** Slow, deep breathing helps lower cortisol levels, reducing feelings of stress and anxiety.
   - **Improved Cardiovascular Health:** Rhythmic breathing supports heart rate variability, promoting heart health.
   - **Lower Blood Pressure:** Controlled breathing can activate the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to relaxation and lower blood pressure.
   - **Better Focus & Mental Clarity:** Oxygenating the brain through controlled breathing enhances cognitive function and concentration.
   - **Enhanced Sleep Quality:** Breathing at a slow pace helps regulate the nervous system, making it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.
   - **Boosted Immune System:** Proper breathing supports oxygen flow, which aids in cell regeneration and overall immune response.
